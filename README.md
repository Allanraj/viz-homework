Stock Analysis of Tesla from 2010 to 2020.

The dataset I have used for my project is Tesla stock analysis from 2010 to 2020. It is a simple dataset with vast volume of date range for last 10years with the fields High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume.

The two interesting figure I found is a image generated using plotly and Seaborn. This gives a great analysis of each filed throughout the last 10years. It is a great analysis of How Tesla stock market and up's and downs of the share they faced in last 10years.


Seaborn gives the overall analysis for each field and plotly we can generate images for each field for a closer and deeper study on each field. I have just uploaded study on one field for reference.
